2. non-contiguous functionality for dragging etc.
3. window resize events - make trhottlesd
4. touch/mobile
5. browser support
6. tests
7. nested  grid support
8. explain existence: Gridster is very much its own system for managing a grid. TODO.... and gridstack again has its own ssysmem todo.... Gridstrap merely calculates the absolute position of the grid cells and makes them so.
